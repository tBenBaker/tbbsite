    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Colby College and affiliated faculty at the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence. My research explores how we understand and model cognitive capacities, and how we understand and interact with artificial intelligence. One strand of my work focuses on internal representations that structure the behavior of biological and artificial systems. Another focuses on how embodiment and expressive movement shape cognition. I have a special interest in studying the mind in dance, and have developed a novel approach to the computational analysis of human movement. I regularly collaborate across disciplines, contributing philosophical perspectives to projects working to simulate neural systems and apply new machine learning methods. At Colby, I teach courses in philosophy of mind, AI, cognitive science, and dance. Before joining the Colby faculty, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in computational neuroscience at UPenn, where I also received my PhD in Philosophy, and I hold a JD from Yale Law School.

    <strong>Courses Taught</strong>
    <p> AI and Human Values<br>
    Central Philosophical Issues: Mind, Body and Machine<br>
    Philosophy of Cognitive Science<br>
    Philosophy of Dance<br>
    Philosophy of Emotion<br>

    <h2>Dance</h2>
    <p>Dance is a major part of my life and identity. My primary background is in hip-hop choreography, popping, and house, and I like to explore many movement styles.</p>

        <h2>About Now</h2>
        <p> Entering year 3 at Colby! Fall colors and fresh student energy to ease the goodbye to the summer sun <br><br>
          Awaiting responses on several fronts: a paper about comparative complexity of agents (biological and artificial) is revised and resubmitted to Minds & Machines, "Six Forms of Dance Cognition" is under review at Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences, a chapter for Routledge about "Rethinking AGI" is on the way, and fingers remain crossed for an NSF proposal on simulating the whole nervous system of C. elegans <br><br>
          The motion lab is coming together -- successfully set up a 3D pose pipeline in the performing arts center and now fine-tuning for accuracy while plotting out the first study. Speaking of motion capture, check out <a href="https://scitube.io/professor-ben-baker-how-computational-methods-can-distinguish-between-hip-hop-dance-styles/" target="_blank">this new SciTube animation</a> about our computational kinematics paper!  <br><br>
          This Fall I'm teaching another iteration of "Mind Body & Machine" -- functionalism and embodiment and AI, oh my -- and a new course called "Bodies and Power" thinking about how institutions and norms treat different bodies. <br><br>
