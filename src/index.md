    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Colby College and affiliated faculty at the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence. My research explores how we understand and model cognitive capacities, and how we understand and interact with artificial intelligence. One strand of my work focuses on internal representations that structure the behavior of biological and artificial systems. Another focuses on how embodiment and expressive movement shape cognition. I have a special interest in studying the mind in dance, and have developed a novel approach to the computational analysis of human movement. I regularly collaborate across disciplines, contributing philosophical perspectives to projects working to simulate neural systems and apply new machine learning methods. At Colby, I teach courses in philosophy of mind, AI, cognitive science, and dance. Before joining the Colby faculty, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in computational neuroscience at UPenn, where I also received my PhD in Philosophy, and I hold a JD from Yale Law School.

        <h2>About Now</h2>
        <p> That's a wrap on my 5th semester at Colby! Glad to have time for research and reflection in January under the low sun, bare branches, and cold clarity.  <br><br>
        New paper with Sonia Roberts on comparing complexity across biological and artificial agents now available at <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-025-09748-7" target="_blank"><em>Minds & Machines</em></a>!
        Looking forward to seeing my chapter on "Rethinking AGI: Beyond Anthropomorphism" come out soon for a Routledge coursebook <em>Introducting Philosophy of Mind, Today</em> <br><br>
        Heading to this year's Eastern APA conference to give comments on a paper about Virtual Embodied AI -- expecting an interesting discussion! <br><br>  
        Continuing some projects on computational analysis of dance and other complex human movement, working on some theory-side and some praxis-side problems.
        The motion lab continues to develop. 3D pose pipeline in the performing arts center is up and running, with some tinkering to do to improve accuracy. I contributed to a recent <em>Dance Magazine</em> article on <a href="https://dancemagazine.com/ai-motion-capture-dance/#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">AI-Assisted Motion-Capture Technology</a>. And check out <a href="https://scitube.io/professor-ben-baker-how-computational-methods-can-distinguish-between-hip-hop-dance-styles/" target="_blank">this SciTube animation</a> about the "computational kinematics" paper from last year! <br><br>
        I've got three courses on deck for the Spring: "Mind Body & Machine," "Philosophy of Dance" and "Philosophy of Science"<br><br>
