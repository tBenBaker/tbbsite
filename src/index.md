    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Colby College and affiliated faculty at the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence. My research explores how we understand and model cognitive capacities, and how we understand and interact with artificial intelligence. One strand of my work focuses on internal representations that structure the behavior of biological and artificial systems. Another focuses on how embodiment and expressive movement shape cognition. I have a special interest in studying the mind in dance, and have developed a novel approach to the computational analysis of human movement. I regularly collaborate across disciplines, contributing philosophical perspectives to projects working to simulate neural systems and apply new machine learning methods. At Colby, I teach courses in philosophy of mind, AI, cognitive science, and dance. Before joining the Colby faculty, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in computational neuroscience at UPenn, where I also received my PhD in Philosophy, and I hold a JD from Yale Law School.

        <h2>About Now</h2>
        <p> Wrapping up Fall Semester #3 at Colby. Starting to miss basketball in the driveway, starting to dream of snowboarding.  <br><br>
        My paper with Sonia Roberts on coparing complexity across biological and artificial agents was accepted at <em>Minds & Machines</em> -- you can check it out <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-025-09748-7" target="_blank">here</a>!
        Also excited for my chapter for Routledge on "Rethinking AGI: Beyond Anthropomorphism," which will come out when the coursebook is finished.<br><br>
        Recently gave a new (for me) kind of presentation --- a convocation address at Loomis Chaffee School on their annual theme, "What does it mean to be human?" Still decided what to do with this piece...<br><br> 
        At this year's Eastern APA conference I'm commenting on a paper about Virtual Embodied AI -- expecting an interesting discussion! <br><br>  
        The motion lab continues to develop. 3D pose pipeline in the performing arts center is up and running, with some tinkering to do to improve accuracy. Plotting the first study for the Spring. I contributed to a recent <em>Dance Magazine</em> article on <a href="https://dancemagazine.com/ai-motion-capture-dance/#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">AI-Assisted Motion-Capture Technology</a>. And check out <a href="https://scitube.io/professor-ben-baker-how-computational-methods-can-distinguish-between-hip-hop-dance-styles/" target="_blank">this SciTube animation</a> about the "computational kinematics" paper! <br><br>
        This Fall I've been teaching another iteration of "Mind Body & Machine" -- functionalism and embodiment and AI, oh my -- and a new course called "Bodies and Power" thinking about how institutions and norms treat different bodies. In the Spring I'll teach Mind Body & Machine again, alongside Philosophy of Science and Philosophy of Dance.<br><br>
