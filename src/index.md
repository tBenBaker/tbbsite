    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I'm a professor working mainly on issues at the intersection of philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. I'm in the philosophy department at Colby, having come from a Computational Neuroscience postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania, where I also received my PhD in Philosophy. Before that I was at Yale Law School for my JD.
    <br><br> 
    My background lets me approach questions about cognition, AI, and ethics from multiple angles. I'm especially interested in how our capacity for abstract thought interacts with our physical experience of the world an our bodies -- a curiosity that has led me to explore these issues through the lens of dance and movement. In my research, in the classroom, and in other ways engaging with my academic community, I'm passionate about contributing to our understanding of the relationships between mind, body, and technology.
    <br><br> 
    I also love playing basketball, snowboarding, reading sci-fi/fantasy, and listening to music. I'm nostalgic about videogames and anime, and excited about cyborgs. Home is Northeastern US and wherever I'm with my partner Sheela and our kids Kavya and Asha.

        <h2>About Now</h2>
        <p>Moving right along in year 2 at Colby! <br><br>
         I'm revising a draft about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) for a Routledge coursebook in Philosophy of Mind, developing the next steps of my work using computational methods to analyze movement, and contributing to a grant proposal aimed at simulating the nervous system of the c. elegans worm down to the molecular level.<br><br>
        In the classroom, I'm teaching an intro-level 'Mind & Machine' course and an upper-level 'Philosophy of Emotion'. I'm excited to be slated for a senior majors' seminar called 'AI and Human Values' in the Spring.<br><br>
        In November I'll be giving a talk at James Madison University, in April I'll be part of the Technology & Cognition symposium at the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology, and then giving a talk at Oberlin's Colloquium in Philosophy.<br><br>
    
        And I'm shooting hoops in the driveway as much as I can before Maine's winter sets in.</p>
