    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Colby College and affiliated faculty at the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence. My research explores how we understand and model cognitive capacities, and how we understand and interact with artificial intelligence. One strand of my work focuses on internal representations that structure the behavior of biological and artificial systems. Another focuses on how embodiment and expressive movement shape cognition. I have a special interest in studying the mind in dance, and have developed a novel approach to the computational analysis of human movement. I regularly collaborate across disciplines, contributing philosophical perspectives to projects working to simulate neural systems and apply new machine learning methods. At Colby, I teach courses in philosophy of mind, AI, cognitive science, and dance. Before joining the Colby faculty, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in computational neuroscience at UPenn, where I also received my PhD in Philosophy, and I hold a JD from Yale Law School.

        <h2>About Now</h2>
        <p> Midway through the semester in year 3 at Colby, balancing classes, research, and the change of season.  <br><br>
          Got some good research news: a paper on comparing complexity across biological and artificial agents (with Sonia Roberts) was accepted at <em>Minds & Machines</em>. "Six Forms of Dance Cognition" remains under review at <em>Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences</em>, and the chapter for Routledge on "Rethinking AGI: Beyond Anthropomorphism" is moving ahead. <br><br>
          The motion lab continues to develop — we’ve set up a 3D pose pipeline in the performing arts center and are fine-tuning for accuracy while plotting the first study. Speaking of motion capture, check out <a href="https://scitube.io/professor-ben-baker-how-computational-methods-can-distinguish-between-hip-hop-dance-styles/" target="_blank">this SciTube animation</a> about our computational kinematics paper. I’m also starting new conversations with colleagues from Penn about how to approach foundation modeling of movement. <br><br><br><br>
          This Fall I'm teaching another iteration of "Mind Body & Machine" -- functionalism and embodiment and AI, oh my -- and a new course called "Bodies and Power" thinking about how institutions and norms treat different bodies. <br><br>
