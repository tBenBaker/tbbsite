    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Colby College and affiliated faculty at the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence. My research explores how we understand and model cognitive capacities, and how we understand and interact with artificial intelligence. One strand of my work focuses on internal representations that structure the behavior of biological and artificial systems. Another focuses on how embodiment and expressive movement shape cognition. I have a special interest in studying the mind in dance, and have developed a novel approach to the computational analysis of human movement. I regularly collaborate across disciplines, contributing philosophical perspectives to projects working to simulate neural systems and apply new machine learning methods. At Colby, I teach courses in philosophy of mind, AI, cognitive science, and dance. Before joining the Colby faculty, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in computational neuroscience at UPenn, where I also received my PhD in Philosophy, and I hold a JD from Yale Law School.

    <strong>Courses Taught</strong>
    <p> AI and Human Values<br>
    Central Philosophical Issues: Mind, Body and Machine<br>
    Philosophy of Cognitive Science<br>
    Philosophy of Dance<br>
    Philosophy of Emotion<br>
    Philosophy of Visual Perception<br>
    Introduction to Ethics

    <h2>Dance</h2>
    <p>Dance is a major part of my life and identity. My primary background is in hip-hop choreography, popping, and house, and I like to explore many movement styles.</p>

        <h2>About Now</h2>
        <p>Now in my second Spring semester at Colby, getting more fully engaged in the academic community there and in the rhythm of life in Maine. <br><br>
         Some things I'm up to: revising a draft about a non-anthropomorphic view of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for a Routledge coursebook in Philosophy of Mind; finishing a draft about the forms of thinking that are essential to dance; developing the next steps of my work using computational methods to analyze movement, including setting up a motion capture lab in Colby's performance arts center. <br><br>
        In the classroom, I'm teaching an intro-level 'Mind, Body & Machine' course, and a senior majors seminar called 'AI and Human Values'. Winding down the semester now, excited for our Philosophy Symposium linked to the AI seminar, for which we'll have Henry Shevlin come speak and visit our class. <br><br>
        I recently had the pleasure of speaking at the Technology & Cognition symposium at the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology, presenting at Oberlin's Colloquium in Philosophy, and contributing to the Slippage: 3D Humanities Series at Northwestern University.<br><br>
        Finally been able to wheel my basketball hoop back out to the driveway for midday shootarounds.
